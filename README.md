# Data-Portfolio
Hi, I'm Bruno! I'm a Data Analyst with a background in Production Engineering. I've developed a strong foundation in data analytics through hands-on experience, academic projects, and continuous learning. I'm passionate about transforming data into actionable insights and using technology to solve real-world problems.

In my professional journey, I’ve worked with tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, BigQuery, and Spark to build data pipelines, create dashboards, and develop models that support strategic decisions and process optimization. As a Data Analyst, I’ve contributed to business intelligence and data engineering initiatives, helping teams translate complex datasets into clear and impactful stories.

Currently, I'm developing my graduation thesis on applying machine learning models to real estate price prediction — a project that reflects my growing interest in AI and predictive analytics.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring public datasets on Kaggle, learning new tools and working on personal development.

This GitHub portfolio is a space to showcase my projects, share knowledge, and track my progress in the fields of Data Analytics and Data Science.
